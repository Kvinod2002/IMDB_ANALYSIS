# IMDB_ANALYSIS
Introduction
After briefly going through the IMDB movie dataset, one can start to notice some correlations or trends between various characterstics of the movie. The pertinant business question that any Data Analyst would ask when browsing through this data set is to find out what characterstics of movies produce the highest revenue. This investigation and reaserch would help the film industry to work on those characterstics that would generate the highest revenue and by extension increase the movies popularity

It is due to these above mentioned reasons, that I have decided to keep one major overaching question that would drive the entire investigation and from which other sub-questions and trends would be discovered.
